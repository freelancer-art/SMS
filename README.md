# Co-op Housing Society Digital Operations & SaaS Platform

A highly polished, modern, and production-ready digital operations platform designed for **Co-op Housing Societies**, **Apartment Complexes**, and **Gated Communities**. This full-stack system pairs a **Super-Admin Developer Panel** with an interactive **Mobile Simulator** replicating a native iOS/Android companion app experience built on **Expo SDK 51** and backed by a **Supabase REST Database API**.

## 🚀 Key Achievements & Core Functionalities

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture & Duplicate Disambiguation
* **Super-Admin Console**: Dedicated control panel to register customer societies (housing societies, residential co-operatives, commercial complexes).
* **Automated Disambiguation Engine**: Prevents credential routing collisions when societies share identical names (*"Om Residency"*) by auto-generating unique `SocietyCode` identifiers (`OMRE1`, `OMRE2`) and URL slugs (`om-residency-a1b2c3`).
* **Instant Tenant Allocation**: Allocates isolated database tenant IDs, seeds welcome circulars, and loads starter member directories.
* **Forced Password Reset Gate**: Route guard enforcing password changes for first-time account logins with temporary credentials (`MustChangePassword: true`).

### 2. Committee Governance & Granular RBAC Permissions
* **7 Standard Roles**: Dedicated access control for `SOCIETY_ADMIN`, `PRESIDENT`, `SECRETARY`, `TREASURER`, `AUDITOR`, `GATE_STAFF`, and `RESIDENT`.
* **Granular Permission Keys**: Enforces operational boundaries (`billing:write`, `gatekeeper:write`, `voting:write`, `committee:write`, `settings:write`).

### 3. Discretionary Module Catalog & Feature Toggles
* **Tenant Discretion**: Societies toggle modules ON/OFF individually via `enabled_modules` JSONB configuration settings (`gatekeeper`, `billing`, `voting`, `water_meters`, `facility_booking`, `tenants`, `document_vault`).
* **RLS Enforcement**: Disabling a module hides visual tabs and enforces HTTP 403 / 0-row restrictions on underlying API routes.

### 4. Advanced Security, Gatekeeper & Staff Operations
* **Simulated Gatekeeper Cabin**: Live gate kiosk for guards to scan QR visitor passes, verify passcode entries, register delivery arrivals, and check out guests.
* **Camera / QR Code Scanner Simulator**: Real-time pass token scanner for rapid visitor access authorization.
* **Domestic Staff Entry & Attendance Module**: Track maids, cooks, drivers, and daily workers with passcode/QR check-in/out, live 'Inside Premises' logs, and flat assignment directories.

### 5. NOC Clearance, Assets & AMC Contract Tracking
* **Resident NOC Workflow**: Step-by-step move-in/move-out NOC requests with Treasurer dues verification, Secretary authorization, and refundable deposit tracking.
* **Society Asset & AMC Register**: Track elevators, DG sets, water pumps, and fire safety equipment with vendor contracts and automated 30-day expiry notifications.

### 6. Notifications, Financial Billing & Analytics
* **Real-Time Notification Bell Center**: Unread count badges, category filtering (Emergency, Gate, Notice, Billing), auto-notifications on gate check-ins, and push notification dispatch service.
* **Sticky Emergency Banner**: High-visibility top alert banner on resident home view for water, power, or security emergencies.
* **Batch Invoicing & Printable PDF Receipts**: Auto-calculate maintenance fees and print formatted PDF receipt statements with GST breakups and transaction IDs.
* **Flat Dues History Ledger**: Dedicated transaction history modal within member profiles filtering invoices and payments specifically for that flat with chronological date, type, amount, status badges, and payment modes.
* **Recharts Financial Insights Panel**: Interactive expense analytics panel in the dashboard utilizing Recharts `BarChart` to group society debit outflows by category (Repairs, Utilities, Elevators, Cleaning, Security, etc.) and visualize monthly spending patterns.

### 7. Offline Sync Strategy & Bulk Data Onboarding
* **IndexedDB Offline Queue & Resilience**: Intercepts failed network payload requests during connectivity dropouts, stores queued updates in IndexedDB (`society_offline_store`), and displays an **Offline Sync Status Banner** with a manual **"Sync Now"** button to flush updates back to the Supabase REST API when back online.
* **CSV Member Directory Bulk Import**: CSV-to-JSON parser component (`MemberCsvImportModal`) allowing society admins to download a pre-formatted CSV template (`FlatNo, OwnerName, ContactNo, Email, Balance`), validate records, and batch import members directly into the local directory and database.

### 8. Multi-Role Mobile Simulator (Admin & Resident App)
* **Visual Device Shell**: Elegant mobile viewport matching modern smartphone dimensions with Expo SDK 51 companion code.
* **Role-Based Workspaces**:
  * **Admin View**: Access to settings, ledger controls, notice publishing, committee RBAC, staff tracking, NOC clearance, asset AMC register, CSV bulk import, expense analytics, and audit logging.
  * **Resident View**: View outstanding dues, view flat dues history, log online maintenance payments, print PDF receipts, track complaints, pre-approve guest passes, view staff attendance, apply for NOCs, and vote in AGM polls.
